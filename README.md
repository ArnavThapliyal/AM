Organization
Software Trello, Asana, Atlassian, etc. etc. there are a lot of there but I find then to be pretty useless in practice, so I want to develope somthing that I will use to organise my plans.

## 🧑‍💻 Goal
The objective of this project is to develop **AM**, a Jarvis-like software assistant, with the goal of having an MVP ready within **2 years** (May 2025 - May 2026).

### **Capabilities in the 2-Year Time Frame:**
- **Core AI Agents**: Build intelligent agents that can automate tasks, manage reminders, control smart devices, and respond to user commands.
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Implement NLU for seamless voice and text communication with AM.
- **Task Automation**: Automate daily tasks like setting reminders, sending emails, or fetching information.
- **Integration with APIs**: Enable AM to connect with third-party services such as calendars, emails, home automation, etc.
